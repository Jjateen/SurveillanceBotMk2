## [Demo Video](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jjateen_ai-ml-electronics-activity-7143582599070818305-wCSS?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

Surveillance Bot Mk2 is an advanced AI semi-autonomous robot designed for cutting-edge surveillance applications. This repository contains the code and documentation for the project.

## Features

- **Wireless Control:** Navigate the robot wirelessly through a user-friendly web app joystick.
- **Object Detection:** Real-time object detection powered by the MobileNetSSD network.
- **Image Collection:** Utilizes ESP32CAM to collect high-quality images via a local Flask webserver and GET requests.
- **Live Video Feed:** Experience the future with a live video feed displaying object detection on the sleek web app interface.

## MobileNetSSD Caffe Model

The MobileNetSSD (Single Shot Detector) is a deep learning model specifically designed for efficient object detection. This network is trained using the Caffe deep learning framework, and it's optimized for embedded devices such as ESP32CAM, ensuring low-latency, real-time performance.

MobileNetSSD can detect multiple objects such as people, vehicles, and common objects, making it ideal for surveillance applications. The **MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel** file contains the pre-trained model weights, while **MobileNetSSD_deploy.prototxt.txt** defines the architecture of the network.

For more information about how the MobileNetSSD model works, you can explore the [Caffe Model Zoo](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/wiki/Model-Zoo).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get Surveillance Bot Mk2 up and running:

### 1. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have all the necessary Python libraries installed. You can install them from the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set Up ESP32CAM

- Configure your ESP32CAM module and ensure it's connected to the robot.
- Flash the appropriate firmware to allow the camera to stream video and capture images.
- Confirm that the camera module is properly aligned with the bot for clear video feed.

### 3. Run Flask Webserver

To enable image collection, run the Flask web server, which will handle incoming GET requests from the ESP32CAM:

```bash
flask run
```

This will start a local web server, where the camera feed can be accessed in real-time.

### 4. Launch the Web App

Open the provided web application in your browser. This interface allows you to control the robot remotely using a joystick and displays the live video feed with real-time object detection powered by the MobileNetSSD model.

### 5. Tutorial: Object Detection and Surveillance Setup

1. **Object Detection Integration:** 
   - The MobileNetSSD model has been integrated into the robot's system to provide real-time object detection.
   - The web interface not only displays the video feed but also highlights detected objects with bounding boxes and labels.

2. **ESP32CAM Configuration:**
   - Ensure that the ESP32CAM module is connected to your local Wi-Fi network. This allows it to stream data to the Flask server, which then processes the frames using MobileNetSSD.

3. **Web App Control:**
   - Navigate the robot through the web app using the joystick and monitor the live feed simultaneously. This allows you to spot objects and navigate the bot accordingly.
   
4. **Image Storage:** 
   - Captured images are stored locally, and you can retrieve them for further analysis or log them for security purposes.

### 6. Testing and Calibration

To ensure smooth operation, test the ESP32CAMâ€™s connectivity and object detection by navigating the robot around your environment. Adjust the camera angles or parameters based on the lighting conditions for optimal performance.

## Usage

- Connect to the robot's web app interface and use the joystick for wireless control.
- View the live video feed with real-time object detection.
- Capture and store images for review.
